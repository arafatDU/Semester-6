# Software Design and Analysis

This repository contains notes, summaries, and insights from the 6th semester course **Software Design and Analysis**. The primary reference for this course is the book **Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design** by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).

## About the Book: Clean Architecture

**Clean Architecture** provides practical advice on designing robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems. The book covers fundamental principles, architectural patterns, and best practices for structuring codebases that are easy to understand, test, and evolve.

## Chapter Summaries

### 1. Introduction
Introduces the importance of software architecture and the need for clean, maintainable code.

### 2. A Tale of Two Values
Discusses the dual value of software: behavior and structure, and the trade-offs between them.

### 3. Paradigm Overview
Explains the three main programming paradigms: structured, object-oriented, and functional.

### 4. Structured Programming
Covers the basics of structured programming and its impact on software design.

### 5. Object-Oriented Programming
Explores the principles of OOP, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### 6. Functional Programming
Introduces functional programming concepts and their relevance to clean architecture.

### 7. SRP: The Single Responsibility Principle
Describes the importance of assigning one responsibility to each module/class.

### 8. OCP: The Open-Closed Principle
Explains how software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### 9. LSP: The Liskov Substitution Principle
Covers substitutability and how derived classes should extend base classes without altering behavior.

### 10. ISP: The Interface Segregation Principle
Advocates for small, client-specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones.

### 11. DIP: The Dependency Inversion Principle
Emphasizes depending on abstractions, not concretions.

### 12. Component Principles
Discusses principles for organizing code into components: cohesion, coupling, and reuse.

### 13. Component Cohesion
Explores how to group related classes and modules together.

### 14. Component Coupling
Covers managing dependencies between components.

### 15. Architecture
Defines what architecture is and why it matters.

### 16. Independence
Discusses achieving independence from frameworks, UI, databases, and external agencies.

### 17. Boundaries: Drawing Lines
Explains how to draw boundaries between different parts of a system.

### 18. Boundary Anatomy
Describes the anatomy and structure of boundaries in software systems.

### 19. Policy and Level
Differentiates between high-level policy and low-level details.

### 20. Business Rules
Focuses on encapsulating business rules and logic.

### 21. Screaming Architecture
Advocates for architectures that clearly communicate their intent.

### 22. The Clean Architecture
Presents the Clean Architecture model: layers, dependencies, and flow of control.

### 23. Presenters and Humble Objects
Discusses separating logic from presentation and minimizing dependencies.

### 24. Partial Boundaries
Explores partial application of boundaries in real-world systems.

### 25. Layers and Boundaries
Details the use of layers and boundaries to structure systems.

### 26. The Main Component
Explains the role of the main component in application startup and dependency injection.

### 27. Services: Great and Humble
Differentiates between core and peripheral services.

### 28. The Test Boundary
Covers strategies for testing and maintaining test boundaries.

### 29. Clean Embedded Architecture
Applies clean architecture principles to embedded systems.

### 30. Conclusion
Summarizes key takeaways and encourages continuous improvement in software design.
