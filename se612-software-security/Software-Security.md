## Three Pillars of Software Security

The three pillars provide a foundation for building secure software:

1. **Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to minimize their impact.
2. **Assurance**: Ensuring that security requirements are met through verification and validation.
3. **Awareness**: Promoting security knowledge and best practices among stakeholders.

## Risk Management Framework

A structured approach to managing security risks throughout the software lifecycle. Key steps include:

- **Categorize**: Define the system and its environment.
- **Select**: Choose appropriate security controls.
- **Implement**: Apply the selected controls.
- **Assess**: Evaluate the effectiveness of controls.
- **Authorize**: Make risk-based decisions for system operation.
- **Monitor**: Continuously track security posture.

## Security Touchpoints

Security touchpoints are integration points for security practices within the software development lifecycle. The seven key touchpoints are:

1. **Code Review**: Analyze code for vulnerabilities.
2. **Architectural Risk Analysis**: Identify design-level security flaws.
3. **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks to find weaknesses.
4. **Security Testing**: Automated and manual testing for security issues.
5. **Risk-Based Security Testing**: Prioritize tests based on risk.
6. **Abuse Cases**: Model potential misuse scenarios.
7. **Security Requirements**: Define and enforce security needs from the start.
