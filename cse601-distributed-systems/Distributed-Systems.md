# 🌐 Distributed Systems – Course Repository

This repository documents my learning and coursework for the **Distributed Systems** course, currently running in the 6th semester of my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering program. The course focuses on the design, architecture, and challenges of building systems that run on multiple networked computers.

---

## 📘 Course Overview

**Distributed Systems** explores the principles, models, and engineering practices behind distributed computing. It covers how independent components of a system work together as a unified platform, offering scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.

## 🧠 Topics Covered (So Far)

- ### 🔹 Introduction to Distributed Systems
  - Definition and significance
  - Real-world examples (e.g., cloud services, blockchain, distributed databases)

- ### 🎯 Goals of Distributed Systems
  - Transparency (access, location, concurrency, replication, failure)
  - Openness and scalability
  - Fault tolerance and reliability

- ### ⚠️ Challenges in Distributed Systems
  - Synchronization and time management
  - Partial failure and recovery
  - Consistency and coordination
  - Scalability and latency

- ### 🏛️ Architectures of Distributed Systems
  - **Layered Architecture**
  - **Object-Based Architecture**
  - **Data-Centric Architecture**
  - Middleware and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA)
  - Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer Models

## 🧪 Lab Project: Smart Library System

As part of the lab component, I am working on a **Smart Library System** project. The development process involves transitioning through different architectural models:

### 🔧 Project Stages:
1. **Monolithic Architecture** – Build the system as a single unified application.
2. **Microservices Architecture** – Break down the system into independently deployable services.
3. **Nginx Configuration** – Use Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer for service coordination.
4. **Docker Integration** – Containerize the entire system using Docker for portability and scalability.

This hands-on project is designed to practically demonstrate core distributed systems concepts like modularization, service discovery, inter-service communication, and deployment orchestration.

## 🚧 Status

The course is **currently ongoing**. More topics, source code, and detailed documentation of the lab project will be added as the semester progresses.
