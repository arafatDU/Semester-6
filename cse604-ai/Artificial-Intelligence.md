## 🧠 First Project Assignment: **MiniChess AI**

As a hands-on assignment, we developed a MiniChess (6x5) game engine using adversarial search algorithms.

### 🔗 [MiniChess Project GitHub Repository](https://github.com/arafatDU/minichess)

#### Project Highlights:
- **Minimax Algorithm** for AI decision-making.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for optimization.
- **Heuristic Evaluation Function** for state scoring.
- RESTful API using **FastAPI**.
- Frontend using **Next.js** to play against AI.

> This project integrates core concepts from the course and simulates intelligent behavior in a strategic game environment.
